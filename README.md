Lasso regression is a linear regression technique that uses L1 regularization. It's essentially a variant of linear regression that adds a penalty term to the ordinary least squares (OLS) objective function. 

The objective function of Lasso regression is:

\[ \min_{\beta} \frac{1}{2n_{\text{samples}}} ||X \beta - y||_2^2 + \alpha ||\beta||_1 \]

Where:
- \( X \) is the matrix of input features.
- \( y \) is the vector of target values.
- \( \beta \) is the vector of coefficients to be estimated.
- \( \alpha \) is the regularization parameter that controls the strength of regularization.

The first term \( \frac{1}{2n_{\text{samples}}} ||X \beta - y||_2^2 \) represents the ordinary least squares (OLS) loss function, which measures the squared difference between the predicted values and the actual target values.

The second term \( \alpha ||\beta||_1 \) is the L1 regularization term. It penalizes the absolute values of the coefficients, forcing some of them to become zero. This encourages sparsity in the coefficient vector, effectively selecting a subset of the most important features and performing feature selection as part of the modeling process.

So, in summary, Lasso regression uses a linear model (ordinary least squares) with an additional L1 penalty term for regularization.
